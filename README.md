# Applied Data Science Capstone

Companies are making space travel more affordable such as Space X which is owned by Elon Musk. Multiple things that Space X do make it more successful than other companies such as having better prices for rocket ,and the ability to recover these rockets. Space Y is a company that is trying to compete with Space X. Instead of using rocket science , Space Y will be hiring me as a data scientist to gather data about Space X in order to determine launch price ,and the reuse of the first stage if its successful or not.
